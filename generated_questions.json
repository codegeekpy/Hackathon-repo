  "In a multi-user system, if two users simultaneously run CPU-intensive applications, how does the operating system manage the processes, and what impact does context switching have on performance, considering the resources shared between parent and child processes?",
  "Consider a scenario where multiple server processes need to access and update a shared database.  How can you design a message-passing-based IPC mechanism to prevent race conditions and deadlocks while maintaining efficient data sharing?",
  "A web server uses a thread pool to handle client requests, sharing database connections and file I/O buffers among threads.  How can developers prevent potential deadlocks resulting from these shared resources, and what synchronization strategies might be employed?",
  "Consider a web server handling multiple client requests simultaneously.  How does the operating system manage the execution of these client requests as independent processes, ensuring responsiveness and resource efficiency?  What potential issues might arise if the system does not properly manage context switching or process creation?",
  "A multi-user operating system manages file access using shared memory for concurrent read operations.  Describe a real-world scenario where a race condition could lead to data corruption in this system and how a deadlock might arise if the system doesn't implement proper synchronization. Propose a strategy to prevent such a deadlock, highlighting the synchronization mechanism you would employ.",
  "A web server uses a thread pool to handle client requests, sharing database connections and file I/O buffers among threads.  How can the system architect prevent deadlocks arising from concurrent access to these shared resources, and what are the trade-offs between different prevention strategies?",
  "Consider a real-time embedded system managing multiple sensor readings and controlling actuators.  Given the overhead of context switching, how can a system designer optimize process scheduling for minimal latency while ensuring all processes receive adequate CPU time in a multi-process environment with varying real-time constraints?  Analyze the trade-offs between resource utilization and responsiveness in this context.",
  "A team is developing a high-performance, distributed file system.  Given the need for concurrent access and modification of files by multiple users, how can they architect an efficient and deadlock-free IPC strategy for the file system using shared memory or message passing?  Consider the trade-offs between performance and complexity, along with the potential for race conditions and deadlocks.",
  "A multi-threaded web server utilizes a thread pool for handling client requests, sharing database connections and file I/O buffers.  How can the application architect employ strategies to prevent deadlocks that may arise due to concurrent access to these shared resources?  Illustrate with specific examples of potential deadlock scenarios and suitable mitigation strategies."
